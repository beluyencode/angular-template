            The pie charts show how much electricity was generated by different types of energy sources in Scotland for
            20 years ago and last year.As it can be seen from both charts, there are some differences in the usage of
            renewable and non renewable energy sources. In fact, last year there was a decrease in regards to the amount
            of electricity generated by hydro pumped storage and hydro natural flow, compared to 20 years.

            However, it appears to be a massive change in the amount of electricity generated by coal, gas and nuclear
            sources. Twenty years ago, people used to use more coal and gas than last year, even though the amount of
            nuclear energy is higher than 20 years ago.

            Although a large number of differences can be spotted in both pie charts, there are also some similarities,
            especially related to the amount of gas used last year and 20 years ago. The percentage between them are
            pretty similar, ranging from 21.7% of gas used last year and 22.3% of 20 years ago.
            In conclusion, despite a few similarities in the amount of electricity generated by gas, most of the amount
            of electricity generated in Scotland changes according to the energy source used both last year and 20 years
            ago.
